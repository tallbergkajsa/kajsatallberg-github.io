                            <h3 class="major">But how did Stejf become Stejf? </h3>
			    <p>It all started in the course User Experience Design and Evaluation at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, 
				    inspired by an event called 'Prototypes for Humanity'. 
				    The mission was clear: create a design that can positively impact humanity. 
				    Recognizing the widespread issue of individuals feeling insecure and anxious 
				    while walking alone in the dark, our team was determined to find a solution.
                            </p>
			
                            
			       <p><b>We began by</b> diving deep into research and analysis, conducting interviews and 
				       surveys to understand the specific needs and pain points of our audience. 
				       Through these conversations, we gained invaluable insights into individual experiences, 
				       uncovering common challenges and concerns. With this knowledge, 
				       we set out to ideate and prototype potential solutions.
                            </p>

                         </span>
                            <p><b>Iterative testing</b> of tangible prototypes allowed us to validate design decisions, ensuring the final prototype not only 
                                addressed user needs but also provided a seamless user experience. Throughout the iterative process, we encountered several conflicting 
                                aspects and ethical concerns of our design, emphasizing the importance of user testing.</p>
                            <h3 class="major">Final design</h3>
                            <p>And so, Stejf was born â€“ a name derived from the fusion of "Stay Safe" in Swedish writing. 
                                The prototype, designed in Figma, was presented at a UX exhibition and received great feedback for its innovative value and seamless design.
			    But for us, the real success of Stejf lies in its potential to make a meaningful impact on people's lives, offering a guide of light in the dark 
			    and paving the way for safer journeys ahead.</p>
