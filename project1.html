                            <h3 class="major">Objective</h3>
							<p>As part of the course User Experience Design and Evaluation at KTH, this project was inspired by 
                            an event called 'Prototypes for Humanity', and aimed to create a design that can positively impact humanity.
                            Recognizing the issue of individuals feeling insecure and anxious while walking alone in the dark, 
                            our project was dedicated to designing a solution that alleviates these concerns, striving to transform 
                            the experience into a more secure one.
                            </p>
                            
                            <h3 class="major">Research and Analysis</h3>
							<p>For the user research phase, we conducted interviews and surveys to identify the specific needs 
                                and pain points of our audience. Through in-depth interviews, we aimed to gain nuanced insights 
                                into individual experiences, extracting valuable qualitative data. Additionally, surveys were 
                                used to collect quantitative data, providing a broader perspective on common challenges.
                                In the subsequent data analysis phase, we identified patterns, uncovered key themes, and 
                                synthesized valuable insights. 
                            </p>

                            <h3 class="major">Ideating and Prototyping</h3>
                            <p>In the ideation and prototyping phase, we translated our insights into actionable design solutions. 
                                Through brainstorming sessions, we generated a diverse range of ideas and user journeys to address 
                                identified pain points. These concepts were then turned into tangible prototypes, 
                                ranging from low-fidelity sketches to interactive mockups.</p>
                            <h3 class="major">User tests and Iteration</h3>
                            <p>Iterative testing allowed us to validate design decisions, ensuring the final prototype not only 
                                addressed user needs but also provided a seamless user experience. Throughout the iterative process, we encountered several conflicting 
                                aspects and ethical concerns of our design, emphasizing the importance of user testing.</p>
                            <h3 class="major">Final design</h3>
                            <p>The final product became "Stejf", a name derived from the fusion of "Stay Safe" in Swedish writing 
                                The prototype, designed in Figma, was presented at a UX exhibition at The Royal Institute of Technology 
                                in Stockholm and received great feedback for its innovative value and seamless design.</p>
