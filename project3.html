                            <h2 class="major">Project Overview</h2>
							<p>This project presents a start-up journey at Monash University in Melbourne as part of the course
                                 Technology and Innovation for start-ups. We were exposed to the most current 
                                 emerging deep technologies including AI, IoT, machine learning and bots, and
                                 the challenge presented was to design an innovative product that 
                                 leverages one of these technologies and influences human lives. The project adopted a 
                                 design-driven innovation perspective and demonstrated how a human-centred 
                                 lens is applied when developing new products, services and technologies. </p>
                                 <p>
                                 My group collaborated to develop a prototype of 
                                 AI-powered glasses for individuals suffering from dementia. Leveraging Artificial Intelligence 
                                 and wearable technology, the glasses aim to enhance the quality of life for dementia 
                                 patients by assisting with memory recall, cognitive support, and overall well-being.</p>
                        
                                 <h2 class="major">Process</h2>
                                 <h3 class="major">Research and Brainstorming</h3>
                                 <p>Recognizing the struggles of individuals suffering from dementia, the project started with a comprehensive blend of market and user research within the field. 
                                    We delved into prior solutions and conducted phone interviews with dementia helplines to identify market gaps and user needs. 
                                    Thereafter, we brainstormed possible solutions that would utilize AI and move beyond already existing ones. 
                                    We researched the technological capabilities of different wearable solutions and AI and conducted additional phone interviews to discuss various features.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3 class="major">Conceptualization and Design</h3>
                                    <p>Having gathered insights, we concluded that wearable glasses stood out as the most appropriate solution, 
                                    allowing many promising features in one product. We started conceptualizing the design and features and created a Lo-Fi prototype of 
                                    the glasses in InDesign and a simple companion app in Canva. Additionally, we 
                                    created images of different use cases from the perspective of the glasses, as seen at the top of this page.

                                <p>
                                    The project ended with a product brief presentation for professionals in the tech industry, featuring a competition across three categories: Best Business, Best Use of Technology, and People's Choice. 
                                    Among many participating groups, our team had the honour of winning the award for "Best Use of Technology."</p>
